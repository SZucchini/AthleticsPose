## ðŸš§ Work in Progress

This repository is currently under development. Basic files and **Dataset** have been uploaded, but the project is still in preparation phase. Please check back later for updates.

## Abstract

This repository contains the implementation for our paper "AthleticsPose: Authentic Sports Motion Dataset on Athletic Field and Evaluation of Monocular 3D Pose Estimation Ability". We introduce a comprehensive dataset and evaluation framework for 3D pose estimation in athletics scenarios.

## Updates

- **2025-08-04**: Added dataset download instructions and license files
- **2025-07-18**: Initial repository setup and basic file upload

## Dataset Download

You can download the AthleticsPose dataset using either wget or curl:

### Using wget
```bash
wget -O AthleticsPoseDataset.zip \
  "https://github.com/SZucchini/AthleticsPose/releases/latest/download/AthleticsPoseDataset.zip"
```

### Using curl
```bash
curl -L -o AthleticsPoseDataset.zip \
  "https://github.com/SZucchini/AthleticsPose/releases/latest/download/AthleticsPoseDataset.zip"
```

After downloading, extract the dataset:
```bash
unzip AthleticsPoseDataset.zip
```

## TODO

- [x] Add dataset files and download instructions
- [ ] Complete README.md with detailed setup and usage instructions
- [ ] Implement inference functionality for arbitrary video inputs
- [ ] Provide pretrained model weights
- [ ] Add documentation for dataset structure and running methods

## Installation
Please use uv to install the package. This will ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed and the package is ready for use.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AthleticsPose.git
cd AthleticsPose

# Install dependencies
uv sync
```
