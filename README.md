## ðŸš§ Work in Progress

This repository is currently under development. Basic files have been uploaded, but the project is still in preparation phase. Please check back later for updates.

## Abstract

This repository contains the implementation for our paper "AthleticsPose: Authentic Sports Motion Dataset on Athletic Field and Evaluation of Monocular 3D Pose Estimation Ability". We introduce a comprehensive dataset and evaluation framework for 3D pose estimation in athletics scenarios.

## Updates

- **2025-07-18**: Initial repository setup and basic file upload

## TODO

- [ ] Add dataset files and download instructions
- [ ] Complete README.md with detailed setup and usage instructions
- [ ] Implement inference functionality for arbitrary video inputs
- [ ] Provide pretrained model weights
- [ ] Add documentation for dataset structure and running methods

## Installation
Please use uv to install the package. This will ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed and the package is ready for use.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AthleticsPose.git
cd AthleticsPose

# Install dependencies
uv sync
```
